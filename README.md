## About

This is a small movie discovery app where you can search for movies and browse what’s trending.

I built this project to get more comfortable with React, working with APIs, and structuring a real frontend app instead of just isolated components.

- Search for movies
- Browse trending titles
- Works well on desktop and mobile

## Built with

- React
